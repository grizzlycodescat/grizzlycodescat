`Full Stack Engineer | Security Enthusiast`

I am a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for Cyber Security. Here is where I'll be penning down my notes, walkthroughs of all the CTFs I'm doing, along with other projects and scripts that might be useful.

	<summary><h3>How I got here</h3></summary>
	I started my career as a drafter at a small engineering company. We all had to play different roles, and I learned to write code for automating things really quickly. I realised I quite liked writing code, and started looking for a way into the coding industry. I got into my first tech company as a technical writer. Interacting with all the developers, I learnt to write clean code, test cases, and automate whatever I could, until eventually I got some frontend developer gigs at different advertising agencies. A few years on, I was rehired by my first tech company, had picked up skills as a full stack engineer and a user experience designer, and was looking at pursuing a long held passion of mine. Cybersecurity.

	I am currently pursuing my OSCP certification, and have been working on as many CTF boxes as I can through Hack The Box. I'm also documenting all my notes, thoughts, and writeups on gitbook.
